# Express Note Taker

## Description
This note taker application was designed to give users a place to create and save notes that persist in the back end. I created an Express.js server that handles HTTP requests made by the client to get existing notes, post new notes and delete unwanted notes (CRUD). This project taught me how to write APIs and handle routing of client requests.
